[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most fastest *static site generator* for building websites writen in [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)). It is a tool which combines a bunch of files and turns them into HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

The content for your site can be written in HTML, JavaScript or *markdown* files. It is very common to write blog posts or technical documentation using Hugo and markdown files.

**This blog** is made with Hugo based on the theme [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng), some custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the posts are made in markdown. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/tanisperez/tanis.codes).

## Why you should use it?
There are many benefits from using Hugo instead of a CMS like WordPress.
* Fully and easy customizable with minimal web knowledge.
* The content is usually written in markdown.
* Lots of free themes availables.
* You can deploy it for free in some hostings, like GitHub Pages.
