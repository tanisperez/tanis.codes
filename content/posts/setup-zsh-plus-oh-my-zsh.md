The Z shell (Zsh) is an Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.

[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins and themes.

## Setup Zsh

If you are using a debian based Linux or WSL, you can install zsh using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zsh
```

The latest Mac OS X versions comes with zsh as the default shell. But if you are using bash, you can install it using the command **brew**:

```bash
brew install zsh
```

When the installation is done, you can set zsh as your default shell using the command **chsh**.
